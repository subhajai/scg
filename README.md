## Summary
The solutino is deployed on Google Firebase functions, using Node.js. The functions can be accessed via the following URL: `https://us-central1-scg-test-d5146.cloudfunctions.net/Test` which requires `?task` parameter.
For example, `https://us-central1-scg-test-d5146.cloudfunctions.net/Test?task=2` for task#2

The functions are experimentally integrated with LINE chat bot, which is the data viewing layer hence there's no need for a user to set up any environment for testing the solutions.
